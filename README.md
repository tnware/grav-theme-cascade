# Cascade

## UPDATE 1/27/2017: I am back after a hiatus. The latest release is in preparation for a complete re-structure of the code with the updated standards.

## GPM Installation (Preferred)

The simplest way to install this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm) through your system's Terminal (also called the command line).  From the root of your Grav install type:

    bin/gpm install cascade

This will install the Cascade theme into your `/user/themes` directory within Grav. Its files can be found under `/your/site/grav/user/themes/cascade`.

## Manual Installation

To install this theme, just download the zip version of this repository and unzip it under `/your/site/grav/user/themes`. Then, rename the folder to `cascade`. You can find these files either on [GitHub](https://github.com/tnware/grav-theme-cascade) or (hopefully soon) via [GetGrav.org](http://getgrav.org/downloads/themes).

You should now have all the theme files under

    /your/site/grav/user/themes/cascade

## GPM Update (Preferred)

The simplest way to update this theme is via the [Grav Package Manager (GPM)](http://learn.getgrav.org/advanced/grav-gpm). You can do this with this by navigating to the root directory of your Grav install using your system's Terminal (also called command line) and typing the following:

    bin/gpm update cascade

This command will check your Grav install to see if your Cascade theme is due for an update. If a newer release is found, you will be asked whether or not you wish to update. To continue, type `y` and hit enter. The theme will automatically update and clear Grav's cache.

# Updating

As development for the Cascade theme continues, new versions may become available that add additional features and functionality, improve compatibility with newer Grav releases, and generally provide a better user experience. Updating Cascade is easy, and can be done through Grav's GPM system, as well as manually.
